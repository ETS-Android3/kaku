Kaku is an application for people learning japanese, who want to practice writing (+reading) kanji on keyboard on their phone!
<br>
Simply open the app, add some kanji and test yourself, everything should work offline (except, of course, the WaniKani integration which requires internet connection, d'uh)

Uses sentences from Tatoeba.org which contain only the kanjis you know.
